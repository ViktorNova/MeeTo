scim-bridge (0.4.14-2ubuntu5) intrepid; urgency=low

  * 50_check_scim_binary.dpatch: Enable again, since the Qt agent really
    does get upset if scim is installed but not running (as is the case in
    many locales). This time, check for whether the scim-helper-manager
    process is running.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Sun, 26 Oct 2008 16:07:56 +0000

scim-bridge (0.4.14-2ubuntu4) intrepid; urgency=low

  All changes thanks to Zheng Peng-Hou.
  * Disable 50_check_scim_binary.dpatch since only a dependency on scim is
    enough. Actually only a running scim-helper is needed, which is in the
    scim package and gets started (and restarted if it dies) automatically.
    However, modified the patch to check for schim-helper instead in case the
    patch becomes necessary again. (LP: #286923)
  * Add patch 50_fix_qt4_focus.dpatch to fix focus loss under KDE4. (LP:
    #250046) 
  * Update debian/control to fix dependencies and the Name of the Original
    Maintainer.
